📰 Fake News Detection App

Detect Fake News using Machine Learning
This project is a Fake News Classification App built with Streamlit and Machine Learning models to predict whether news content is Real or Fake. It supports text input, voice input, visualizations, and text-to-speech feedback.

🚀 Features
✅ Multiple Machine Learning Models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)
✅ Text & Voice Input Support
✅ Real-Time Predictions
✅ Visualizations for Model Comparison
✅ Prediction History Tracking
✅ User Feedback System
✅ Preloaded News Data (True.csv, Fake.csv) for Testing
